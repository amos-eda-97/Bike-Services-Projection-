In order to check run the code , check the file **Linear Regresssion Bike Assignment.ipynb**

While performing linear regression it is important to check out the probelm of muliti-collinearity .

The coefficients of each of the parameters are as follows

I have drawn correlation between different parameters in the following graph . It will make sure to avoid the problem of collinearity
